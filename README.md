# pacman

## My motivation for this project to be able to perform my first animation using javascript.

## This project was built as my firts assignment for my Web development course.

## This project gives me more understanding on how to integrate images and movement to images.

# This allowed me great practice with looping objects and some basic editing of images.

# Main challanges were finding the right pictures for animation.
